This project analyzes and visualizes the 10 Year Inflation Expectation Rate (T10YIE) using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis! It generates 11 different visualizations to illustrate economic trends over time and also highlights major economic events! Some of the graphs include line plots, bar charts, box plots, heatmaps, histograms, violin plots, pie charts, and regression analysis to show trends in multiple ways, which are all what I learnt in creating this project - how to make these types of graphs! I also learnt how to clean data and look at the graphs and find patterns on what happened over time. I struggled with a lot of detailing in these graphs, making sure they all have all the required items to run and not make an error. I also made a mistake and orginally did 5 years of data rather than 10 years so I had to go back and report everything!! As someone who didn't know much python in visualizations specifically, this was really interesting to learn how to use python in new ways, differenrt from what I'm used to. I made this project because I am really interested in both finance and data analysis and wanted to make a technical project combinding both! I made this project in python in vscode and split the code into the starting section, 11 different visualization sections, and the ending section. I started off by not knowing anything, so I did a lot of research into graphing/visualizations and did use a little bit of AI to help with my starting process and the first visualization, which I used as a guide on the other ones!
